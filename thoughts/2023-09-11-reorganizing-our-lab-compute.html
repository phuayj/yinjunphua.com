		<h1>Reorganizing Our Lab Compute</h1>
		<div class="post">
			<p>I recently took on the task to clean up and reorganize our lab compute. Most of the compute servers that we have right now were acquired before I joined the lab. When I decided to help out managing the servers after one of our students graduated, I didn't have a clear picture of all of the servers that we had. The only issue that was brought up to me was that we have run out of physical space in the server room and thus some of the newly bought servers weren't actually deployed yet.</p>
			<p>I had left the servers as is for the most part of 3 months, but when I decided to take a closer look last month, it became clear that none of the students were utilizing the servers, and for students that required compute, they would instead opt to use the HPC clusters provided by either our institution or another institution that we are collaborating with.</p>
			<p>The problem with trying to build up infrastructure in a smaller research unit, like a research lab, is that most of the time, infrastructure requires huge upfront investment. But a huge lump sum of money is very difficult to come by. As such, it is much easier to just purchase whatever we can with the budget that we currently have, and accumulate the hardware over time. However, with a field changing as fast as machine learning, whatever hardware equipment that we bought even 2-3 years ago are now considered rather antiquated.</p>
			<p>So the situation is, we have a bunch of servers with various hardware, some are old and the new ones are rather limited. When I talk to one of our students on why they prefer to use the HPC cluster, one answer was that the library versions and hardware are consistent. Therefore it is easy to always reproduce and get the same results. While the hardware part is currently out of my hands, I could try to fix the software issue.</p>
